<h1><b>Text file compression and decompression using huffman encoding technique</b></h1>
<p>
  Huffman coding is an algorithm used for doing data compression. It encodes a character using a variable-length encoding, assigning characters with higher bits with lesser bits compared to characters with higher complexity.

<p><b>Time complexity:- O(nlogn)</b></p>
<p>
  This program is a simple implementation of huffman coding technique. It uses heap data structure for storing huffman tree. It uses a simple byte sized buffer for write operations while encoding and read operations while decoding a file
